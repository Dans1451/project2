# Project 2- ETL Magic The Gathering
Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 2: Extract, Transform, and Load
## Group 2
Dan Davies and Prakhyath Bagavatula

### Proposal
This projectâ€™s objective was to create a database of all Magic The Gathering cards and their attributes. With this information someone who wants to buy sets of cards as a whole can find the pricing of specific cards through TCGplayer, an online market to buy and sell cards. We extracted all the cards from scryfall and mtgjson. We found that both data sources had some redundant information but also had information unique to each source. We will use pandas to transform the data as well as clean and merge the data into one database. We will load our database into MongoDB and create a relational database and compile tables from our data sources.
